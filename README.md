# 🏥 AI-Diagnosis-and-Doctor-Recommendation-System
 An ML system for predicting and diagnosing diabetes and recommending doctors based on the diagnosis.

# 📌 Overview
This project aims to provide an AI-based health diagnosis system for diabetes detection and doctor recommendations. Using machine learning models, it predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes and suggests specialized doctors for further consultation.

# 🚀 Features
✅ Diabetes Prediction: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict diabetes risk.

✅ Doctor Recommendation: Suggests nearby doctors specializing in diabetes management.

✅ User-Friendly Interface: A simple web-based frontend for ease of use.

✅ Data-Driven Insights: Predicts based on medical parameters like glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: SQLite (for storing doctor recommendations)

# 📊 Dataset Used
The PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle was used for training the diabetes prediction model.

# 📜 Installation
1. Clone the repository

# 📌 Future Scope
Extend diagnosis to heart disease prediction (which is done in the final year project).

Enhance the ML model with deep learning approaches.

Integrate real-time doctor availability.
